### Flower Classification CNN

The goal of this problem is to train a neural network to categorize pictures of flowers into 1 of 5 categories: Daisies, Dandelions, Roses, Sunflowers, and Tulips. I'll create a few different CNN models to train on the image data, and use a portion of the images as the validation set to check how accurate the neural network is at prediction.

This will be using a dataset of flower images taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahmasleam/flowers-dataset/data

There's 2 notebooks:

Flowers.ipynb - The main notebook.

flowers_colab.ipynb - Seperate notebook I made to run some models on Google CoLab (so I could utilize the GPU for faster fitting).
